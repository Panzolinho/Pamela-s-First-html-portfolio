<h1>The best ranked movies according to Pamela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies to watch.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Just go with it</h3>
<p>This is the best comedy movie I have watched by Adam Sandler, a Happy Madison Production</p>
<h3>The negotiator</h3>
<p>Crime action movie,that is so unpredictable and very interesting. You get the chance to see the collab
    between Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey.
</p>
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>Witchery and wizards battling for what is right and wrong. The son of a witch who becomes the center stage
    of this epic movie sequel.
